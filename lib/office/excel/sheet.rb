  # The design rationale behind this class is that a Sheet is a *grid* of cells.
  #
  # It therefore focuses on accessing, manipulating, creating cells as addressed
  # by A1 style locations and A1:CC28 style ranges.
  #
  # This naturally creates some tension with the underlying xlsx xml model,
  # which consists of <row> elements containing many cell <c> elements.
  #
  # xpath queries to access the xml nodes, while not slow, are slower than
  # lookups in ruby Array and Hash structures. So whenever possible, lookup of
  # cell <c> nodes are cached in Array and/or Hash structures. Obviously those
  # caches must be invalidated when row lookup indices are changed by
  # row-oriented insert and delete operations which must renumber subsequent row
  # elements.
